# hardware-usage-monitor-in-terminal
Python **psutil** library can directly interact with OS and can obtain information from OS.
We have 2 parts of this project.
1. Static Part
   It shows the System Information like User, CPU Info, Core Info, RAM, Network Info and Disk info.
2. Dynamic Part
   This portion shows the live usage of CPU and RAM. We used BARs and DASHes to represent the percentage of the usage.
